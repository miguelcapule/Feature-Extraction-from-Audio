# Feature-Extraction-from-Audio
Feature extraction refers to the process of transforming raw data into numerical features that can be processed while preserving the information in the original data set. It yields better results than applying machine learning directly to the raw data.

Feature extraction can be accomplished manually or automatically:

Manual feature extraction requires identifying and describing the features that are relevant for a given problem and implementing a way to extract those features. In many situations, having a good understanding of the background or domain can help make informed decisions as to which features could be useful. Over decades of research, engineers and scientists have developed feature extraction methods for images, signals, and text. An example of a simple feature is the mean of a window in a signal.
Automated feature extraction uses specialized algorithms or deep networks to extract features automatically from signals or images without the need for human intervention. This technique can be very useful when you want to move quickly from raw data to developing machine learning algorithms. Wavelet scattering is an example of automated feature extraction.
With the ascent of deep learning, feature extraction has been largely replaced by the first layers of deep networks â€“ but mostly for image data. For signal and time-series applications, feature extraction remains the first challenge that requires significant expertise before one can build effective predictive models.

Feature Extraction for Signals and Time Series Data
Feature extraction identifies the most discriminating characteristics in signals, which a machine learning or a deep learning algorithm can more easily consume. Training machine learning or deep learning directly with raw signals often yields poor results because of the high data rate and information redundancy.
